# Rust Character Set Extractor

Takes a plaintext `.txt` file and returns all unique characters used in the file, in the order they appear.

## Usage
Use it with `cargo run` or use `cargo build --release` to build an executable file, which is located in `/target/release`, which can be run in a terminal with `./rust_charset_extractor`
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The plaintext `.txt` input file must be named `extract_from.txt` for the program to recognize it.
> A sample is included, so you may just choose to change it's contents.
